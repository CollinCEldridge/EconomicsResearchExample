# Hall Replication Study

This repository contains the data files and R Markdown file I used to write my report, "A Replication of Robert Hall's Permanent Income Hypothesis Study", for my Advanced Topics in Macroeconomics and Finance seminar at Carleton College. 
A PDF of the final report is also included. The Introduction to the report is included below.

'For over 50 years, economists have worked to understand the consumption and savings patterns of United States citizens (cf. Modigliani & Brumberg, 1954). In a significant contribution to this work, Hall (1978) modeled optimal consumption 
in the current period as a function solely of consumption from the previous period, plus a mean-zero error term (making the model of consumption from this paper a random walk with a trend). Hall (1978) examines this model using consumption, 
income, and stock price data, and largely fails to reject it as a plausible model of optimal consumption behavior. I seek to replicate the results of Hall (1978) using updated consumption and income data. Specifically, I aim to answer the question, 
“After accounting for consumption in the previous period (or equivalently, consumption lagged one period), does consumption lagged two or more periods or income lagged one or more periods have any statistical or economic significance when 
estimating consumption in the current period?”'
